# Sdr-Angel-GUI-SKIN-project
SDR ANGEL GUI SKIN development group

The aim of this Group is to develop add on GUI SKINS for SDR ANGEL. these GUI SKINS will provide the user with a graphical representation of the real world hardware counterpart, or a futuristic prototype of a future graphical representation of the same hardware. For instance in a future based skin depicting a graphical rendering of a hardware component. You could rename some features to a new "slang or user defined parameter" known only to those in the community using said skin. It will allow for your imagination to take charge in said instance and bring forth your vission. in the latter case it would be Designing what your dream transciever would look like in a graphical user interface representation. This will be a hub of innovation for rendering digitally our favorite hardware components in a fun digital overlay. as well as allowing some unique personalization of independent or collective group nature. where you may have your own linguistics for certain hardware interfaced features. I belive this will allow one and all a fun and creative workload. while allowing the entire community to grow and enjoy these collective endeavors.
